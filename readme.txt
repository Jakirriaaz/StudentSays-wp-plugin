A few notes about the sections above:

* "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wordpress.org usernames
* "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
* "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
* "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*
* Stable tag must indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version

Note that the `readme.txt` value of stable tag is the one that is the defining one for the plugin.  If the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used for displaying information about the plugin.

If you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

If no stable tag is provided, your users may not get the correct version of your code.
